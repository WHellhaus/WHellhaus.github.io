        <p class="description">The first image you have of a boyband is probably not a diverse hip hop collective that has a distinct and experimental sound and promotes pushing the social boundaries of music, but that is exactly what the boyband Brockhampton is. Sporting more than a dozen members of different racial, economic, religious, and sexual backgrounds I have not witnessed a more inclusive group in hip hop and not just by outward appearances. There music tackles numerous issues that have plagued the hip hop community for years. By sporting some of the most innovative new sounds in music, pushing social boundaries, and creating the most surprising project of last year Brockhampton has proven that they are the best boyband since One Direction.</p>
        <p class="description">I was introduced to Brockhampton by a friend who realized I was impatiently waiting for new Tyler, the Creator music back in July and recommended the group’s surprise project Saturation to me. After that conversation I proceeded to go back home and I had to make the most important decision of any drive, what to listen to. I decided to listen to this new mystery artist Brockhampton. From the first drum beat on Heat I became hooked. I had not heard such aggression from a song in a while. From the boom bap beat to Ameer Vann’s opening verse and hook I was caught extremely off guard. The drums and distorted riff on this song sounded straight out of 36 Chambers era Wu Tang and Joba’s bridge brought some hostile soft metal vibes. As that song ended my phone while, unbeknownst to me, on shuffle, the song Face came on. This song sounded completely different even forcing me to check my radio to make sure the same group was playing. Face opens with a sweet drum loop that proceeds into a xylophone and Joba singing very softly, a stark transition from the track that I had just heard from the same group. When I was able to listen to the whole album cohesively I was left in awe.</p>
